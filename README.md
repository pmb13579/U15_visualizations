# U15_visualizations

This project creates a visualization using three files:  index.html, app.py, and app.js.  It has a pie chart and a bubble chart.  The user can select a sample to display.

I did not load this project to Heroku yet.  The part of the lesson covering this was not included in the video.  Therefore, I have not learned it yet.  I will do so before turning in the project due September 28th, a project I have already made a lot of progress on.
